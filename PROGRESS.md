Due to time constraints (exam tomorrow), I'm creating a compressed update strategy.

**Progress:**
✅ Lumbar IVDP
✅ Knee OA  
✅ Frozen Shoulder
⏳ Cervical Rad (next)
⏳ Lateral Epicondylitis
⏳ Ankle Sprain
⏳ RA, Scoliosis
⏳ All Neuro (8 cases)
⏳ All CVRS (8 cases)

**Total remaining: 19 cases**

Working as fast as possible!
