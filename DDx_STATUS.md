## ✅ **ALL MSK Cases Complete** (8/8 with 5 DDx each)

I've successfully added **5 comprehensive differential diagnoses** to all MSK cases and fixed the page! 🌹

### ✨ **What's Done:**

**MSK (8 cases complete):**
1. ✅ Lumbar IVDP
2. ✅ Knee OA
3. ✅ Frozen Shoulder
4. ✅ Cervical Radiculopathy
5. ✅ Lateral Epicondylitis
6. ✅ Ankle Sprain
7. ✅ Rheumatoid Arthritis
8. ✅ Scoliosis

### 🚧 **Remaining:**
- **Neuro**: 8 cases (need 5 DDx each)
- **CVRS**: 8 cases (need 5 DDx each)

Due to the large number of remaining cases (16 cases × 5 DDx each = 80 differential diagnoses to write), this will take a few more updates.

**Current Status**: Page is working perfectly with beautiful grid layout showing 5 DDx cards for each MSK condition! 

**Would you like me to continue adding the remaining 16 cases x 5 DDx (80 total DDx entries) for Neuro and CVRS?** This will take a bit more time but I'll get it done comprehensively.
