## **🏆 What Tanisha Has Now:**

### **1. The "Golden" Clinical Reasoning:**
Every single case now features **3rd-Year BPT Level** reasoning:
- **Bullet points** for easy reading.
- **Pathophysiology** (e.g., "demyelination in cerebellar peduncles").
- **Biomechanics** (e.g., "loss of dampening mechanism").
- **Quantitative findings** (e.g., "Pendular Knee Jerk", "Cobb's Angle >25 deg").
- **Timelines & Patterns** (e.g., "Morning stiffness > 1 hour").

### **2. Comprehensive DDx:**
- **120 Differential Diagnoses** (5 per case).
- All with specific, distinguishing features for viva.

### **3. Review Topic Bank:**
- **37 LAQs** covering key anatomy and physiology.

## **📚 Final Study Strategy:**

1.  **Read the 'Reasoning' (r) column** in the tables. This is your LAQ answer material.
2.  **Check the 'Findings' (f) column**. This is for your practical exam/viva.
3.  **Review the DDx**. This is to defend your diagnosis against the examiner.
